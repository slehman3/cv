    <h3>Bio: </h3>
    <p>
        I am an undergraduate student at the University of North Carolina - Chapel Hill. I am pursuing a degree in Biomedical Engineering
        <br> and a minor in Chemistry. I am interested in finding an internship for Summer 2020. I would like to apply my skills in STEM, 
        <br> Engineering, or programming to an experience over my break. I am both an American and Dutch citizen. As a result, I can work 
        <br> in either Europe or the US.

    <h3> <strong> Experiences: </strong> </h3>
    <ul>
        <li>
           <em> Innovation Assistant </em> at the North Carolina Translational and Clinical Science Institute 
            <p> 
                 I conducted research on Saphenous Vein Stripping to develop a more efficient medical device for the surgery. I also programmed 
                 <br> Graphviz to create a heat map for my supervisors to track the institute's investments in the UNC Hospital. I interact with 
                 <br> clients to improve their experience in working with the institute. 
            </p>
        </li>

        <li>
            <em>Undergraduate Consultant </em> at UNC Motion Science Institute
            <p>
                I am assisting in the development of a medical device that provides vibrational feedback to correct a patient’s gait. I use Solidworks
                <br> and 3D printing to design and manufacture the exterior casing of the device. Consult my supervisor on plausible designs that 
                <br> incorporate the electronics into a wearable product
            </p>
        </li>
        <li>
            <em> Undergraduate Research Assistant </em> at Margolis Labs
            <p>
                I conducted CD4+ white blood cell isolation, RNA extraction, and cultivation of cells with IL-2 media. I Built and maintained 
                <br> the lab’s data base detailing the location of BSL2/2+ HIVfreezer samples.

    <h3> <strong> Projects </strong></h3> 
    <ol> <!-- created an ordered list -->
        <li>
            Collaborated with in a team to reconstruct a pulse oximeter for my Junior Biomedical Engineering Design class
        </li>

        <li>
            Created a H bridge with p and n channels to run a motor forwards for 5 seconds, stop for 2, and run backwards for 3
        </li>

        <li>
            Prototyped a robotic arm with my brother, a computer engineer, using Solidworks, Additive Manufacturing, and components
            <br> from Thingverse 
        </li>
